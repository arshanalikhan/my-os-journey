# OS Development Journey 



This repository documents my daily progress while learning

low-level systems programming and operating system development

from scratch. 

  
  
## Structure 

- docs        → Daily learning logs

- bootloader → Bootloader-related work

- kernel     → Kernel-related work

- images     → Screenshots and diagrams

 

## Current Status

- Day 4: Protected mode



## Goal

To build a custom operating system (integrating my both engineering branches; CE & CSE ) step by step while

documenting everything I learn publicly.
